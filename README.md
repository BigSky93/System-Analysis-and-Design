Computer Science Class 255: System Analysis and Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project asked me to take on the role of systems analyst. This involved the Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC). I had to collect requirements for this system through the use of a mock interview between analysts and the client. After the interview I had to determine functional, nonfunctional, and user interface requirements. I was then asked to create and evaluate process a variety of different modeling and graph techniques such as process, object, functional, structural, and behaviour models, along with Gantt Charts. I was also introduced to UML diagrams such as use case, sequence, activity, and class diagrams. The DriverPass client wanted a web-based application through a cloud service provider. Using this system students could prepare themselves for the driving test. This included practice tests and lessons. They would be able to create accounts and have profile pages that displayed which tests they had taken and the status of them. They would be able to book driving lessons with drivers whom they could see on their account. These lessons would also have a pickup and drop-off location of their choosing. 
Modification capabilities would also be in place within this system. This would include modifying DMV policies and regulations, lessons, pickup/drop-off locations, password resets, and profile changes.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I was able to determine the requirements of the DriverPass system based of the interview transcript we were given. Using this interview I was able to create the business document, system design document, charts, models, and diagrams. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I was to pick a part of these documents to revise, I would pick all of it. Based on our reading materials, and previous programming classes, iteration is a very important part of the SDLC. To improve all of the work I did her I would improve upon my work be reiterating and learning more about the process with each passing. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

User needs were interpreted as goals for the project. It is important to translate their needs into functionality within the system because that it was they are looking to get out of the system. Once those goals are displayed to the client they may desire to change things or eliminate them entirely. For example, the client wanted each user to have the ability to reset their password if they forgot it or were locked out of it. To implement this within the design, models were made depicting actors or users with having this capability. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Even when designing a small program, I start by filtering through documentation, or collecting requirements. After this I determine what the program has to do to be considered "done." I then begin to write the programs first iteration. Whenever I come upon challenges I resort back to the documentation until I tackle the obstacle I was facing. This can lead to multiple iterations and corrections I make along the way. I think the techniques and strategies I found most helpful throughout this project were the models, diagrams, and charts. This allows you to visualize the processes and flow of the system, which can help you to better understand what the system needs to do and how it does them.
